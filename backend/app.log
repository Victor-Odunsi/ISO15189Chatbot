Final Answer: Measuring the uncertainty of measurement involves several steps, as outlined in ISO 15189. Here are the key steps: 
1. Estimate the uncertainty components: Identify the sources of uncertainty that affect the measurement, such as instrument calibration, operator variability, and environmental factors. Estimate the uncertainty associated with each component using statistical methods, such as the standard deviation of repeated measurements.
2. Calculate the combined standard uncertainty: Use the law of propagation of uncertainty to calculate the combined standard uncertainty (u) from the individual uncertainty components.
3. Determine the coverage factor: Choose a coverage factor (k) that depends on the level of confidence desired. A common value for k is 2, which corresponds to a 95% confidence interval.
4. Calculate the expanded uncertainty: Multiply the combined standard uncertainty (u) by the coverage factor (k) to obtain the expanded uncertainty (U).
5. Express the uncertainty: Report the expanded uncertainty (U) as a range of values, typically in the form of ±U.
For example, if the combined standard uncertainty (u) is 0.5 and the coverage factor (k) is 2, the expanded uncertainty (U) would be 1.0.
Example calculation:
Combined standard uncertainty (u) = 0.5
Coverage factor (k) = 2
Expanded uncertainty (U) = 2 x 0.5 = 1.0
The result of the measurement would be reported as:
Result = 10.0 ± 1.0
This indicates that the true value of the measurement is likely to lie within the range of 9.0 to 11.0.
Note that the uncertainty of measurement should be reported in the same units as the measurement result.
